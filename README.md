## **1. OVERVIEW**
Through out this Project, we we able to provide a high level snapshot of each school district's key metrics. All results were provided to the School Board.

After some time, it was requested to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School, since their results show evidence of academic dishonesty.

Once data is replaced we will repeat the school district analysis and provide the comparison within this report.
